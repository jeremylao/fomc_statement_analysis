the	DT
Federal	NNP
Open	NNP

Committee	NNP
met	VBD
in	IN
June	NNP
suggests	VBZ
that	IN
economic	JJ
activity	NN
is	VBZ
leveling	VBG
out	IN
.	.

Conditions	DT

continued	VBN
to	TO
show	VB
signs	NNS
of	IN

sluggish	JJ
income	NN
growth	NN
,	,
lower	JJR
housing	NN

Businesses	NNS

Although	IN

to	TO
remain	VB
weak	JJ
for	IN
a	DT
time	NN

the	DT
Committee	NNP
continues	VBZ

the	DT

expects	VBZ
that	IN

In	IN

continues	VBZ
to	TO
anticipate	VB
that	IN

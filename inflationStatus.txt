Deflation - Inflation has continued to run below(deflation) the Committee 's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines(deflation) in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.
Deflation - Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low(deflation); most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
Deflation - Inflation is expected to remain low(deflation) in the near term, in part because of earlier declines(deflation) in energy prices, but to rise(inflation) to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines(deflation) in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.
None      - The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
None      - The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
None      - In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.
None      - This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.
Deflation - In light of the current shortfall(deflation) of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.
